## Docker Basics (DevOps Perspective)

### What is Docker?
Docker is a containerization platform that packages an application with its dependencies and runs it as an isolated process.

### Why Docker?
- Consistent environments
- Faster deployments
- Lightweight compared to virtual machines
- Easy scaling and rollback

### Containers vs Virtual Machines
- Containers share the host OS kernel
- VMs run full guest operating systems

### DevOps Context
Docker enables DevOps teams to:
- Ship applications reliably
- Avoid "works on my machine" issues
- Integrate easily with CI/CD pipelines
- Package applications and automation scripts into portable units
