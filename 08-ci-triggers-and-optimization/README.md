# CI Triggers & Optimization

## Overview
This module demonstrates how a CI pipeline can be optimized to run only when necessary, instead of triggering on every change.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Path-based CI execution
- Manual CI triggers
- Scheduled CI runs
- CI noise and cost reduction

## Implementation Notes
The CI logic itself is implemented in the repository-level GitHub Actions workflow.

This directory documents the reasoning and design decisions behind CI trigger optimization.
