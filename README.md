# DevOps Zero to Hero

This repository documents my structured DevOps learning journey,
focusing on Linux, automation, containers, CI/CD, and cloud technologies.

The goal of this repository is to build strong DevOps fundamentals
through hands-on practice, clear documentation, and real-world
operational use cases.

## What This Repository Contains
- Linux fundamentals from a DevOps/server perspective
- Hands-on command execution with documentation
- Multi-distribution experience (Fedora & Arch Linux)
- Clear learning progression from basics to advanced DevOps topics

## Repository Structure
Each directory represents a DevOps domain and includes:
- Concept explanations in Markdown
- Commands practiced during hands-on work
- Scripts and automation (added progressively)
- Real-world DevOps context instead of exam-oriented notes
